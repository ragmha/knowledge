# Design Patterns (JavaScript)

## Creational

|                  |                                                        |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Abstract Factory | Creates an instance of several families of classes     |
| Builder          |  Separates object construction from its representation |
| Factory Method   | Creates an instance of several derived classes         |
| Object Pool      |                                                        |
| Prototype        |  A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned   |
| Singleton        | A class of which only a single instance can exist      |


## Structural

|                   |                                                        |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Adapter           | Creates an instance of several families of classes     |
| Bridge            |  Separates object construction from its representation |
| Composite         | Creates an instance of several derived classes         |
| Decorator         |                                                        |
| Facade            |  A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned   |
| Flyweight         | A class of which only a single instance can exist      |
| Private Class Data|                                                        |
| Proxy             |   An object representing another object                |


## Behavioral

|                           |                                                     |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Chain of Responsibility   |A way of passing a request between a chain of objects|
| Command                   |  Encapsulate a command request as an object         |
| Interpreter               |  A way to include language elements in a program    |
| Iterator                  |  Sequentially access the elements of a collection   |
| Mediator                  |  Defines simplified communication between classes   |
| Memento                   |  Capture and restore an object's internal state     |
| Null Object               |                                                     |
| Observer                  | A way of notifying change to a number of classes    |
| State                     | Alter an object's behavior when its state changes   |
| Strategy                  | Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class            |
| Template Method           | Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass |
| Visitor                   | Defines a new operation to a class without change   |
| Monad Pattern/ Promises   |          -                                           |
