# Redux: The Single Immutable State Tree

*   The entire state of the application will be represented by one JavaScript
object.

*   All changes and mutations to the application are explicit. These mutations,
which include the data and the UI state, are contained in a single object we
call the state.

*   Since the entire state is represented in a single object, we are able to keep track of changes over time
