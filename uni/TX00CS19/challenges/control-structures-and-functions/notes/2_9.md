# 📝 2.9 Variable Arguments

* It's convinent to implement a function that takes a variable number of arguments
```scala
def sum(args: Int*) = {
 var result = 0
 for(arg <- args) result += arg
 result
}

sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```
* Function recieves a single paramater of type `Seq`
* A squence of values cannot be passed directly to a function which recieves multiple args, it results into an error
* If a function for e.g sum is called with one argument, that must be a single integer, not a range of integers. e.g `val s = sum(1 to 5) // Error`
* To add a sequence of values, we need to tell the compiler that the we want a parameter to be considered it as an argument sequence using Append. `: _*` e.g `val s = sum(1 to 5 : _*) // 15`
* The call syntax `:_*`is needed in recursive defination, to tell it that `args.tail` is a argument sequence
```scala
def recursiveSum(args: Int*) : Int = {
  if(args.length == 0) 0
  else args.head + recursiveSum(args.tail : _*)
}
```
* `head` is the sequence of the initial element
* `tail` is the sequence of all the other elements
* `tail` is a `Seq`, we need to use `: _*` to convert it to an argument sequence.
