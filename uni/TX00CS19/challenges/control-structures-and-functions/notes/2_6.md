# 📝 2.5 Advanced `for` Loops

* The construct of `for` loop is much richer in `Scala` than in `Java` or `C++`
* `Multiple generators` of the form `variable <- expression`, seperator by the semicolons
```scala
for(i <- 1 to 3; j <- 1 to 3) print(f"${10 * i + j}%3d")
```
* Each generator can have a `guard`, a Boolean condition preceded by `if`

* Multiple definiations, including variables can be used inside the loop
```scala
for(i <- 1 to 3; from = 4 - i; j <- from to 3) print(f"(${10 * i + j}%3d")
```
* `for` loop starts with `yeild`, the loop constructs a collection of values for each iteration
```scala
for(i <- 1 to 10) yield i % 3
```
* This above type of loop is called `for comprehension`

* Generating a string
```scala
for( c <- "Hello"; i <- 0 to 1) yield (c + i).toChar
```

* Generating a vector
```scala
for(i <- 0 to 1; c <- "Hello") yeild (c + i).toChar
```

* Use `new lines` instead of `semicolons` if you use newlines of semicolons to seperate them
```scala
for { i <- 1 to 3
  from = 4 -i
  j <- from to 3
}
```
