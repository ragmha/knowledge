# 2.7 📝 Functions

* In addition to methods, it has functions
* Method operates on an object, but a function doesn't
* In Java, you need to imitate them with static methods
* Defining a function, specify the function name, parameters(with it's type) and body
```scala
def abs(x: Double) = if (x >= 0) x else -x
```
* For non-recursive function the return type isn't required
* Scala compiler determines the return type from the type of the expression to the right of the `=` symbol
* Body of the function requiring more than one expression, use `block`
* Last value of the `block` becomes the value that the function returns
```scala
def fac(n : Int) = {
  var r = 1
  for(i <- 1 to n) r = r * i
  r
}

fac(4)
```
* Using `return` keyword is not commonly done in `Scala`
* It's better not to use the `return` keyword, because of `anonymous function`, there `return` doesn't return a value to the caller but breaks out to the enclosing named function
* `return` is kind of `break` statements for functions, but should be used to breakout functionality
* Recursive function, you must specify the return type
```scala
def fac(n: Int) : Int = if (x >= 0) 1 else n * fac(n)

fac(4) // => 24: Int
```
* Programming languages such as `Haskell` or `ML` can infer the type of a recursive function, using the `Hindley-Milner` algorithm. It doesn't work well with `object-oriented` language. Extending `Hindley-Milner` algorithm so it can handle subtypes is still a research problem
