# üìù 2.4 Input and Output

* Printing a value use `print` or `println`

* `printf` function available for formatted printing

* String interpolation available as well
  * E.g print(f"Hello, $name! In six months, you'll be ${age + 0.5}%7.2f years old. %n")

* Formatted string are prefixed with letter `f`

* Using the `f` interpolator is better than `printf` method because it is `type-safe`

* Formatted strings are one of 3 predefined string interpolators in Scala lib.

*  Prefix `s`, strings contain expression but not format directives

* Prefix `raw`, escapes sequences in a string are not evaluated

* To include sign such as `$`in interpolated string, double it
  * E.g s"$$$price"

* Defining own interpolatores is possible

* Interpolators that produce compile-time errors(such as the f interpolator) needs to be implemented as `macros`

* Reading line of input from console , use `readLine` method in `scala.io.StdIn` class

* Reading numeric, Boolean or character value use `readInt`, `readDouble`, `readByte`, `readShort`, `readLong`, `readFloat`, `readBoolean` or `readChar`

* `readLine` method takes a prompt string
```scala
  import scala.io
  val name = Stdin.readline("Your name: ")
  print("Your age: ")
  val age = Stdin.readInt()
  println(s"Hello, ${name}! Next year, you will be ${age + 1}.")
```
