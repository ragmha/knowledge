# 📝 2.12 Exceptions

* Simiar to Java or C++
```scala
throw new IllegalArguemntException("x should not be negative")
```
* Computation is aborted, runtime system looks for exception handler that can accept an `IllegalArguemntException`
* If handlers don't exists, the program terminates
* There is no "checked" exception, you don't have to declare that a function or method might throw an exception
* If the method might throw an `IOException`, you need to declare it.Forces to think where those exception should be handled.
* A `throw` expression has a special type of `Nothing`. It is useful in `if/else` expression. If one branch has a type `Nothing`, the type of the `if/else` expression is the type of the other branch
```scala
val x = -1
if (x >= 0) {
	scala.math.sqrt(x)
}else {
	throw new IllegalArgumentException("x should not be negative")
}
```
* First branch has the type `Double`, the second has the type `Nothing`. Thus, the `if/else` expression also has the type `Double`
* Syntax for catching exception is modeled after the pattern matching syntax
```scala
var url = new URL("http://hortsmann.com/fred-tiny.gif")

try {
  process(url)
}catch {
   case _: malformedURLException => println(s"Bad URL: $url")
   case ex: IOException => ex.printStackTrace()
}
```
* `_` is used for the variable name if you don't need it
* `try/finally` statement lets you dispose of resource weather or not an exception has occured
```scala
var in = new URL("http://hortsmann.com/fred-tiny.gif").openStream()

try {
  process(in)
}finally {
  in.close()
}
```
* `finally` clause is executed whether or not the `process` funcion throws an `exception`.The `reader` is always closed
* `try/catch` statement handles **exceptions**
* `try/finally` statement takes some action (usually cleanup) when an exception is not handled
* Can be combined into a single `try/catch/finally` statement
  * `try{...}catch{ ... }finally{ ... }` `<--similar->` `try{ try{...}catch{ ... } }finally{ ... }`
* Combination of `try/catch/finally` is rarelly useful
* Doesn't have an anolog to the Java `try-with-resource statement`
  * Eg. using scala-ARM library
```scala
import resource._
import java.nio.file._
for (in <- resource(Files.newBufferedReader(inPath)));
     out <- resource(Files.newBufferedReader(outPath)) {

     }
```
* `Try` class is designed to work with computations that may fail with `exceptions`
```scala
import scala.io._
val result =
  for (a <- Try { StdIn.readLine("a: ").toInt}; b <- Try { StdIn.readLine("b: ").toInt }) yield a / b
```
* If exception occurs in either of the above calls, because of division by zero, the result is a `Failure object`, containing the exception that caused the computation to fail.Otherwise the result of the computiaion is  a `Sucess object`
