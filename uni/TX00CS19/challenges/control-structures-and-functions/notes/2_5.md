# üìù 2.5 Loops

* Scala has similar to `while` and `do` loops
* Scala has 2 choices for a loop.
```scala
for (i <- 1 to n)
  r = r * i
```
* `to` method of the `RichInt`, returns a `Range` of the numbers from 1 -> n (inclusive)
```scala
for(i <- expr)
```
* `i` traverse all values of the expression to the right `<-`
* Traversal depends on the type expression
* No `val` or `var` before the variable in `for` loop.
* The type of the variable is the element type of the collection
* The scope of the loop variable extends until the end of the loop.
* When traversing a string, you can loop over the index values
```scala
val s = "Hello"
var sum = 0
for (i <- 0 to s.length -1)
sum += s(i)
```
* Directly looping over characters without using indexes
```scala
var sum = 0
for (ch <- "Hello") sum += ch
```
* Loops are not used in Scala, instead you can process the values in sequence by applying a function to all of them with a single method call
* There is no `break` or `continue` statements to break out of loop
* For `break`, use a few option
  * Use a `Boolean` control variable
  * Use` nested function`- you can `return` from the middle of a function
  * Use the `break` method in the `Breaks` object
  ```scala
  import scala.util.control.Breaks._
  breakable {
    for (...) {
      if(...) break; // Exists a breakable block
      ...
    }
  }
  ```
  * From the above the `control` transfer is done by throwing and catching an exception, so you should avoid the mechanism when time is of essence
* Java doesn't allow having 2 local variables with same name and `overlapping scope`
* Scala doesnt't have such prohibition, the normal shadowing rule applies.
 ```scala
 val n = 1

 for(n <- 1 to 10) println(n)
 ```
