# üìù 2.11 Lazy Values
* Values declared as `lazy`, it's initialization is deferred until it's accessed for the first time
```scala
lazy val words = scala.io.Source.fromFile("/usr/share/dict/words").mkString
```
* If the program doesn't call `words`, it's not accessed
* Lazy values are useful to delay costly initialization statements
* It can also deal with other initialization issues, such as circular dependencies
* Essential for developing lazy data structures such as `Streams`
* Lazy values are halfway between `val` and `def`
```scala
val words = scala.io.Source.fromFile("/usr/share/dict/words").mkString // Evaluataed as soon as words is defined
lazy val words = scala.io.Source.fromFile("/usr/share/dict/words").mkString // Evaluated the first time words is used
def words = scala.io.Source.fromFile("/usr/share/dict/words").mkString // Evaluated every time words is used
```
* `Laziness` is not cost free, everytime a `lazy value` is accessed,a **method** is called that **checks** in a **threadsafe manner**, whether the value has already been initialized
