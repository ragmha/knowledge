# üìù 2.3 Block Expressions and Assignments

* In C++/JAVA, block statements are sequence of statements enclosed in `{ }`

* In Scala use statements whenever there i multiple actions in the body of branch or loop statement

* In Scala a `{ }` block contains a sequence of `expressions` and the result is also an `expression`.The value of the block is value of the ** last expression**

* Useful if initialization of val takes more than one step

```scala
val distance = { val dx = x- x0; val dy = y- y0; sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy) }
```

* value of `{}` is the last expression, in the above case `sqrt`. `dx` and `dy` are only needed as intermediate values in computation

* In scala, **assignments** have no value, or strictly speaking they have a value of type `Unit`. The `Unit` type has as single value written as `()`

* A block that ends with an assignment such as
  * E.g `{ r = r * n; n -= 1 }` has a `Unit` value

* Assignments have `Unit` value, thus can't be chainned together.
  * E.g `x = y = 1 // Nopee`

* Value of `y = 1 ` is `()`
