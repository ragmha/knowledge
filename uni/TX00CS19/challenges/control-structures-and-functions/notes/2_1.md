# 2.1 Conditional Expressions

* Scala has `if/else` construct similar to Java or C++

* if/else has a value, namely the value of the expression that follows the if or else
  * E.g `if (x > 0) 1 else -1` // has a value of 1 or -1 depending on the value of x

* The value can be put into a variable:
  * E.g `val s = if (x > 0)  1 else -1` which is similar to `if (x > 0) s = 1 else s = -1`

  * first form is better because it can be used to intialize it as `val` instead of `var` in second form

* `x > 0 ? 1: -1` is equivalent to `if (x > 0) 1 else -1`

* Scala combines `if/else` and `?:` constructs that are seperate in Java and C++

* Scala, every expression has a type.
  * E.g.1 `if (x > 0) 1 else -1` has the type `Int`, because both branches have the type `Int`

  * E.g.2 `if (x > 0) "positive" else -1` has the type `mixed-type` expression, is the common supertype of both branches. One branch is `java.lang.String` and other `Int`. Their common supertype is called `Any`


* If the `else` part is omitted
  * E.g `if (x > 0) 1` then it's possible that `if` statement yeilds no value.

* In Scala, every expression is supposed to have some value. This is finessed by introdcing a class Unit that has one value, written as `()`

* An `if` statement without an `else` is equivalent to
  * E.g `if (x > 0) 1 else ()`

* `()` is a placeholder for "no useful value", and of `Unit` as an analog of `void` in Java or C++

*  `void` has no value, wherase `Unit` has one value that signifies "no value"
  * E.g an empty wallet and a wallet with bill labeled "no dollars"

* Scala has no `switch` statement, but it's has a much more powerful `pattern matching` mechanism
