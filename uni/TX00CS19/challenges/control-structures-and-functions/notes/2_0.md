# Chapter 2. Control Structures and Functions

## Highlights
* An `if` expression has a value

* A block has a value- the value of its last expression

* The Scala `for` loop is like an "enhanced" Java `for` loop

* Semicolons are (mostly) optional

* The `void` type is `Unit`

* Avoid using `return` in a function

* Beware of missing `=` in a function definition

* Exceptions work just like in Java or C++, but you use a `pattern matching` syntax for `catch`

* Scala has no checked exceptions
