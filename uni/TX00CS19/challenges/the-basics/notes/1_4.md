# 📝 1.4 Arithmetic and Operator Overloading

*  Arithmetic operators  `+ - * / %`

*  Bit operators  `& | ^ >> <<`

*  In `Scala` operators are actually **methods** 😮
 `a + b` *<-shorthand->* `a.+(b)`

* `+` , is the name of the method

* Defining `methods` with just about any symbols for names

* `BigInt` class defines a method called `/%` which returns a pair containing the quotient and remainder of a division

* Written as `a method b`, shorthand for `a. method(b)`, where method is a method with **2 parameters** `(one implicit, one explicit)`
  * Eg. `1.to(10)` <--can be written as --> `1 to 10`


*  Scala doesn't have `++` / `--` , Use this `+=1` / `-=1` **instead**

  * Eg. `counter+=1` *// **Increments** `counter` with 1*


*  `++` method cannot be implemented, since `Int` class is **immutable** thus an integer value can't be changed 😉

*  Using mathematic operators such as `BigInt` and `BigDecimal`

```scala
  val x: BigInt = 1234567890
  x * x * x // Yields 1881676371789154860897069000
```
*  From the above example, if such is done in java we would have called `x.multiply(x).multiply(x)`

*  **Operator overloading** is not possible in Java, because they didn't want operators such as `!@$&*`

*  **Operator overloading** feature is available in Scala 😄
