# 📝 3.3 Traversing Arrays and Array Buffers
* Scala is more uniform
* Traversing an Array / ArrayBuffer with a `for` loop
```scala
for (i <- 0 until a.length)
  println(s"$i: ${a(i)}")
```
* `until` method is similar to the `to` method, except it includes the last value, i.e  the variable goes from 0 to `a.length -1`
* The construct `for (i <- range)`
* The construct makes the variables `i` traversable of all values of the range
* To visit every second element, let i traverse
```scala
0 until a.length by 2 // Range (0, 2 ,4, ...)
```
* Vist elements from the end of the array, traverse
```scala
0 until a.length by -1 // Range(...,2 , 1 ,0)
```
* Instead of `0 until a.length` or `0 until a.length by -1`, we can use `a.indices` or `a.indices.reverse`
* If indices are not required, we can call the array elements directly
```scala
for (elem <- a) println(elem)
```
* Similar to `enhanced` for loop in `Java`
