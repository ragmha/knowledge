## Modern JavaScript Features

## Getters/ Setters

#### Example 1 
```javascript

let obj = {
	a : 7,
	
	get b() {
		return this.a + 1;
	},
	
	set b(x) {
		this.a = x / 2;
	}
	
}

obj.a; // => 7

obj.b; // => 8 (Getting b)

obj.b = 50 // => (Setting a value to b)

obj.a // => 25 (Getting b)

```

#### Example 2

```javascript
let obj = {
	firstName: "Raghib",
	lastName: "Hasan",
	
	get fullName() {
		return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
	},
	
	set fullName(value) {
		let fullNameArr = value.split(" ");
		this.firstName = fullNameArr[0];
		this.lastName = fullNameArr[1];
	}
	
}

obj.fullName; // => Raghib Hasan

obj.fullName = "21 Savage"; // => Setting new FullName

obj.firstName; // => 21

obj.lastName; // => Savage

```


> Getters and Setters are psudo-properties that return or set a dynamically computed value

* `get` - is a property that enables us to dynamically retrieve the value of properties based on the internal state of the object.

* `set` - is the opposite and enables us to dynamically set the state of an internal property of an object.

### Why are they valuable ?

 Getters and Setters allow us to dynamically generate properties based on the current state of the object and to dynamically modify the values of an objects properties by setting them.

## Object.keys

> Converting the keys of an object to an array

#### Example 1

```javascript
let dictionary = {
	"yolo" : "what you say before doing something crazy",
	"gg": "good game, also used sarcastically when you win",
	"swag": "swag swag"
};

let keys = Object.keys(dictionary);

let upperKeys = keys.map(key => key.toUpperCase());

upperKeys; // => ["YOLO", "GG", "SWAG"]

```

#### Example 2

```javascript
let obj = {
	"one" : 1,
	"two" : 2,
	"three" : 3
}

// Traditional Way

/*
for (var key in obj) {
	if (obj.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
		console.log(obj[key]);
	}
}
*/


let keys = Object.keys(obj);

let timesTwo = keys.map(key => obj[key] * 2);

timesTwo; // => [2, 4, 6]

```

### What it does ?
Object.keys is a function on the Object constructor that takes in an object and outputs that object into an array

### Why is it valuable ?
Array's have far more useful helper methods and by using Object.keys instead of traditional `for(var key in obj)` syntax it is much easier to chain transformational methods to the object in the same way we would do with an array

## Var, Let & Const
> ES5 `var` is not block scoped can have unexpected behavior. `let` & `const` are block scoped to fix this.

#### Example 1

```javascript

// ES5 var 
var str = "hi"

if (true) {
    var str = "bye";
}

str; // => "bye"


// ES6 let
let str1 = "hi"

if (true) {
    let str = "bye";
}

str;// => "hi"


// ES6 const
const str2 = "hi";

if (true) {
    str2 = "bye";
}

str2; //=> error: "hi" is read-only 

```


#### Example 2

```javascript

var day = "today";

if (true) {
	var day = "tommorow";
	
}

day // => tommorow


// Hoisting process

var day = undefined;
day = "today"
day = "tommrow"

day // => tommorow

```

### What are the `let` & `const` keywords ?

* `let` is just like `var` except it is blocked scoped, which prevents variables from being hoisted to the top of our scope during javascript declaration, which is what occurs with `var` keyword.

* `const` is just like `let` except for it cannot be reassigned after it has been intialized with a value. It is also block scoped.


## Why is it useful?

* Blocked scoped variables declarations behave similar to most other languages. when using ES2015 you should always use `let`and `const` instead of `var`;
